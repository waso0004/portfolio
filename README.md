# Portfolio

## About the Portfolio
This portfolio showcases my work as an Interactive Media Design student, highlighting my skills in web development, design, and photography. It is designed to provide a seamless user experience across devices, with a focus on responsive design and accessibility.

## Development Process
The development process began with planning the structure and layout of the portfolio. I started by sketching wireframes to visualize the design and navigation flow. Once the structure was finalized, I moved on to coding the website using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap for responsiveness. 

I prioritized creating a clean and modern design that reflects my personal style while ensuring the content is easy to navigate. The portfolio includes sections for an introduction, mission statement, about me, and contact information, along with interactive elements like collapsible cards and a responsive navigation menu.

## Challenges Faced and Solutions
1. **Responsive Design**:
   - **Challenge**: Ensuring the website looks good on all screen sizes, especially for the "About Me" section and the collapsible navigation menu.
   - **Solution**: I used Bootstrap's grid system and utility classes to create a responsive layout. Media queries were also used for custom adjustments.

2. **Custom Styling with Bootstrap**:
   - **Challenge**: Integrating custom styles (e.g., color palette, typography) while using Bootstrap's predefined classes.
   - **Solution**: I utilized CSS variables (`:root`) to define a consistent color scheme and applied custom styles where necessary, while leveraging Bootstrap for most of the layout and components.

3. **Interactive Elements**:
   - **Challenge**: Adding interactive elements like collapsible cards and the offcanvas navigation menu.
   - **Solution**: I used Bootstrap's built-in JavaScript components, such as the `collapse` and `offcanvas` features, to implement these functionalities without additional libraries.

4. **Image Optimization**:
   - **Challenge**: Ensuring images load quickly without compromising quality.
   - **Solution**: I optimized images using online tools and ensured they were appropriately sized for different screen resolutions.

   I gained a deeper understanding of responsive design and how to use Bootstrap's grid system effectively to create layouts that adapt to various screen sizes.

2. **Bootstrap Integration**:
   I learned how to balance using a framework like Bootstrap with custom CSS to achieve a unique design while maintaining consistency and efficiency.

3. **Problem-Solving**:
   Overcoming challenges during development taught me how to troubleshoot issues, research solutions, and implement best practices in web development.

4. **User-Centered Design**:
   Creating a portfolio helped me focus on designing for the user, ensuring the website is intuitive, visually appealing, and accessible.
